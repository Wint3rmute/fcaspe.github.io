*Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.* - Arthur C. Clarke

It was a a couple of years ago, when I got the change of getting such an amazing piece of engineering. 
This post is to present a series of pictures I took with my favorite camera: the Polaroid 600SE.
This fine instrument belongs to the so-called cathegory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_camera" target="_blank">Press Cameras</a>, rugged and reliable, targetted for professional photographers,
reporters, insurance agents, and so on. It produces a one-and-unique picture that could not be tampered with.

The Polaroid 600SE is a very special version of a press camera since it was intended to be used with professional instant film, called **peel-apart instant film**, 
or *Type 100*; a marvel of mechanical and chemical engineering that works as a complete darkroom inside a cardboard sleeve that develops and finishes a color picture in
60 seconds. The process is oddly satisgying: You peel off the photo from the sleeve like a sticker. But it is also a socializing tool: people gets maravelously mesmerized
with such a camera, while having possibility of taking and giving away beautiful pictures. Actually, I gave away more than half the pictures I took.

This film was produced between 1960 and 2016, by both Polaroid and Fujifilm. When production stopped, millions of peel-apart cameras (either professional or consumer-level)
were left completely orphan. Fortunately, a company in Viena is <a href="https://supersense.com/oneinstant/" target="_blank">trying to revive the film format</a>.

By the time I knew about the format, the last production run was being shipped. Luckily, I found the camera exactly when
I stumbled upon a classified ad advertising some 2012-expired Fuji FP100C peel-apart film: I bought the camera and extinted film at the same time.

After some time I got the possibility to go to India to do an internship in Karunya University, near Coimbatore - Tamil Nadu. I loaded my camera
and 10 packs of film - and boy I was happy with that camera!
