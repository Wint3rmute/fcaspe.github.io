## Lo Barato Sale Caro

Lo Barato Sale Caro was my primary music project. A flexible funk power-trio of friends that generally incorporated guest musics in the gigs,
I had the best of the times playing with them. While being the main vocalist and composer, I played the guitar or the synthesizer depending of the song.

The flexibility of the band allowed me to explore different genres within it, such as
blues, funk, Classic R&B and West Coast. In 2017 we issued our first and only EP comprising five original songs.

## Eclécticos
Eclécticos was a pop band with original songs and many popular covers. I played as a regular drop-in keyboardist when time allowed me.
The composer, guitarist and friend Pablo Benedetti invited me to record synthesizer and Rhodes piano in two of their songs.

## Novansamba Duo
With Novansamba I explored the enchanting sound of Bossa-Nova. An excellent middle step for learning jazz armony while keeping things not so complicated.
While playing in this duo I learned many interesing armonic and rythmic techniques in guitar playing. I also jumped to the piano from time to time.
